# **Dev Peek**

Dev Peek is a lightweight and developer-friendly browser extension for Microsoft Edge. It provides a seamless way to inspect UI elements on a webpage by simply hovering over them, displaying an overlay and a tooltip with detailed information. Unlike traditional DevTools, HoverPeek allows developers to focus on the UI without compromising screen real estate.

- **Tooltip Information**: Displays tag name, class names, and dimensions of the hovered element.
