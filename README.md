# **Dev Peek 2.0**

Dev Peek is a powerful, developer-friendly browser extension that brings Figma-like design and inspection capabilities directly to your web page. It provides a seamless way to inspect and edit UI elements in real-time, displaying an overlay and a draggable editor panel with detailed information and live editing tools.
